# Minesweepr NHZ

I created this game for my second semester programming project.
It is written in C++, i used CMake to compile it. For the graphics I used the SFML library. All the assets used were made by me.

## Features

It has all the functions of the well known microsoft minesweeper.

**In additon:**
- In the main menu you can change the color theme.
- You can save a game you've started and later reload to continue from where you left off.  
- You can zoom in and out using the Q and E keys.
- You can pan the camera using WASD.
